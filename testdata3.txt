Abstract:Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4CRBN, is the target of theimmunomodulatory drugs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Recently, it was demonstrated that binding of thesedrugs to CRBN promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of two common substrates, transcriptionfactors Aiolos and Ikaros. Here we report that the pleiotropic pathway modifier CC-122, a new chemical entitytermed pleiotropic pathway modifier binds CRBN and promotes degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros in diffuse largeB-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and T cells in vitro, in vivo and in patients, resulting in both cell autonomous as well asimmunostimulatory effects. In DLBCL cell lines, CC-122-induced degradation or shRNA mediated knockdown ofAiolos and Ikaros correlates with increased transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) independent ofinterferon α, β, γ production and/or secretion and results in apoptosis in both ABC and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Ourresults provide mechanistic insight into the cell of origin independent anti-lymphoma activity of CC-122, in contrastto the ABC subtype selective activity of lenalidomide.
Introduction:Diffuse Large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounts for approximately 40% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma andexhibits distinct epidemiological, genetic and clinical features 1,2. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies tostandard chemotherapy has improved the 5 year overall survival to 58%, a significant number of patients willrelapse 3. To date, the outcomes for these relapsed/and or refractory (R/R) and high-risk patients remainparticularly poor. Gene expression profiling has identified at least two large subgroups within DLBCL based oncell of origin (COO): a germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and an activated B-cell (ABC) subtype 4,5. Eachsubtype exhibits different pathogenic mechanisms and have different clinical outcomes, with ABC-DLBCL havingan inferior prognosis to chemotherapy containing regimens in both frontline and salvage settings 4-7. Given theincreased understanding of DLBCL disease biology, novel targeted agents including immunomodulatory drugsare being developed to treat high risk and R/R DLBCL patients 8.
 Recent studies on the mechanism of the immunomodulatory agents, including lenalidomide andpomalidomide, reveal a new paradigm of drug action on protein homeostatic mechanisms. Crystallographicstudies show that these drugs bind to a tri-tryptophan pocket on the surface of Cereblon, a substrate receptorprotein of the Cullin 4 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4CRBN) 9,10.  Binding of IMiD compounds to Cereblonresults in recruitment of two critical transcription factors for lymphogenesis, Aiolos and Ikaros, to Cereblon leadingto their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In multiple myeloma cell lines, the degradation ofAiolos or Ikaros by either lenalidomide treatment or by shRNA mediated knock-down reduced IRF4 transcriptionand protein levels, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity 11,12. Additionally, the co-stimulatory effects of IMiDcompounds on T-cell activation was determined to be through degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros, negativeregulators of interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression 12,13.  The role of Aiolos and Ikaros in DLBCL has not been defined,nor are the consequences of targeting these transcription factors in DLBCL. A novel pleiotropic pathway modifiercompound originally developed for broad DLBCL activity, CC-122, has provided unique insight into this area ofDLBCL biology. The chemical structure of CC-122 (Figure 7) includes the glutarimide moiety that is known tointeract with Cereblon as recently described by Chamberlain et al 9. CC-122 is currently in Phase I trials and hasdemonstrated single agent clinical activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 14,15.
